**To the Admissions Committee,**

I am writing to enthusiastically recommend [Student Name] for admission to your school. I have had the privilege of serving as both [his/her] computer teacher and class teacher for the past [timeframe], which has given me unique insight into both [his/her] technical abilities and overall character.

In my computer classes, where I teach the standard curriculum from our textbook, [Student Name] often finishes assignments quickly and then uses the remaining time pursuing independent projects. I've observed [him/her] in our lab working through coding problems—not from assignments I've given, but from [his/her] own exploration and learning. What strikes me most is that [he/she] approaches these problems through [his/her] own thinking and logic, demonstrating genuine understanding rather than just following tutorials.

[Student Name] is largely self-taught in programming. While I've helped clarify some concepts—particularly in C++—and answered occasional questions when my administrative duties permit, [he/she] has independently learned web development, programming languages, and problem-solving approaches far beyond our school's curriculum. I'm sometimes amazed at what [he/she] shows me, having learned it entirely on [his/her] own using just an old phone. To be frank, [his/her] technical knowledge in many areas now exceeds what I can teach, and [he/she] needs mentorship and resources beyond what our school can provide.

What impresses me beyond technical skill is how [Student Name] learns. [He/She] doesn't wait for instruction—[he/she] identifies what [he/she] needs to know and finds ways to learn it. When stuck on a problem, [he/she] persists until finding a solution, sometimes staying after class or working during free periods. This self-direction and problem-solving approach is rare among students.

As [his/her] class teacher, I've observed [Student Name's] character in daily school life. [He/She] is respectful, diligent, and maintains good relationships with classmates despite being quite different in interests and focus. While [he/she] often works independently on technical projects, [he/she] is willing to help other students when they struggle with computer assignments. [He/She] never complains about our school's limited resources or the fact that I cannot give [him/her] the advanced guidance [he/she] needs due to time constraints and administrative responsibilities.

I should mention some areas for growth. Because [Student Name] has worked so independently for so long, [he/she] is accustomed to solving everything alone. At your school, [he/she] will need to learn to seek help more readily, to collaborate with peers who may have different approaches, and to accept guidance even when [he/she] thinks [he/she] already knows the answer. [He/She] may also need support balancing [his/her] intense focus on technical work with other subjects and activities—I've noticed [he/she] sometimes becomes so absorbed in a coding problem that [he/she] neglects other things.

[Student Name] comes from very modest circumstances. [His/her] family lives on limited means, [his/her] parents don't speak English or understand computers, and [he/she] has never had access to a laptop or proper equipment. Despite these significant barriers, [he/she] has achieved technical proficiency that many students with every advantage never reach. This tells me everything about [his/her] character, determination, and potential.

In [X years] of teaching, I've encountered very few students with [Student Name's] combination of technical ability, self-direction, and intellectual hunger. [He/She] has genuinely outgrown what our school can offer. What [he/she] needs now—and what your school can provide—is proper mentorship from expert faculty, access to appropriate resources and equipment, collaborative peers who can challenge [his/her] thinking, and an academic environment that can channel [his/her] capabilities effectively.

I believe [Student Name] will not only thrive at your school but will contribute meaningfully to your community. [His/her] unique perspective—having built everything from nothing—will enrich classroom discussions and inspire other students. [He/She] may also bridge gaps between students of different backgrounds, understanding both limitation and opportunity deeply.

I recommend [Student Name] without any reservation. [He/She] is ready for this challenge, and your school is exactly the kind of environment where [his/her] exceptional potential can fully develop.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss [Student Name] further or if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
