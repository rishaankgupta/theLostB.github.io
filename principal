**To the Admissions Committee,**

I am pleased to recommend [Student Name] for admission to your School. As Principal of [School Name] for [X years], I have observed [him/her] over the past [timeframe] and can speak to [his/her] character, academic potential, and readiness for the rigorous environment at your School.

[Student Name] stands out in our school community for [his/her] exceptional self-direction and intellectual curiosity. While many students wait for teachers to assign work, [he/she] actively seeks knowledge independently. [**PRINCIPAL CAN ADD SPECIFIC EXAMPLE/OBSERVATION HERE - e.g., "I recall when..." or "One instance that impressed me was..."**]

What distinguishes [Student Name] is not just academic capability, but character. [He/She] demonstrates [**PRINCIPAL CAN ADD SPECIFIC CHARACTER TRAITS OBSERVED - e.g., integrity, respect for others, responsibility, etc.**]. In a school environment where resources are limited, [he/she] has never complained about what we cannot provide, instead finding creative ways to pursue [his/her] interests.

I should mention that [Student Name] comes from very modest circumstances. [His/Her] family has limited financial means and [his/her] parents have minimal formal education. Despite these challenges—or perhaps because of them—[he/she] has developed remarkable independence and resilience. [He/She] manages [his/her] own educational journey with minimal parental guidance, which speaks to both maturity and capability.

[**PRINCIPAL CAN ADD ANY CONCERNS OR AREAS FOR GROWTH HERE - e.g., "One area where I hope school will support growth is..." This makes the letter more credible.**]

In [X years] as an educator, I have encountered few students with [Student Name's] combination of intellectual drive, personal integrity, and adaptability. [He/She] is ready for challenges beyond what our school can provide. School's resources, mentorship, and community would allow [him/her] to reach [his/her] considerable potential.

I recommend [Student Name] without reservation and am confident [he/she] will contribute meaningfully to your school community while growing personally and academically.

Please feel free to contact me if you need additional information.

Sincerely,

**Asha Sharma**
