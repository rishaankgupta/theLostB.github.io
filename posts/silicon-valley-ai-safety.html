                <p>
                    The AI safety conversation has a peculiar character. On one side, tech leaders warn of existential
                    risk with almost religious fervor—AI could be humanity's "final invention," our potential destroyer
                    or savior. On the other, skeptics dismiss these concerns as science fiction masquerading as serious
                    analysis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Both camps are missing something important. The existential risk framing, while not entirely wrong,
                    obscures more immediate concerns. And the dismissals underestimate genuine risks that are already
                    manifesting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What follows is an attempt at a more nuanced view—one that takes AI seriously as a transformative
                    technology without succumbing to either techno-utopian optimism or apocalyptic doom.
                </p>

                <h2>The Existential Risk Distraction</h2>

                <p>
                    Silicon Valley's AI safety discourse centers on a particular scenario: superintelligent AI that
                    either deliberately harms humanity or optimizes for goals misaligned with human welfare. This
                    framing has problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem 1: It assumes a discontinuity that may never come.</strong> The "AI suddenly becomes
                    superintelligent" narrative imagines a discrete threshold crossed. But AI development might continue
                    as incremental improvement, never producing the clearly-defined superintelligence these scenarios
                    require.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem 2: It's extremely speculative.</strong> We don't understand consciousness,
                    intelligence, or goal-directed behavior well enough to predict how hypothetical superintelligent
                    systems would behave. Claims about AI "wanting" things or "deceiving" us project human psychology
                    onto fundamentally different systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem 3: It crowds out more tractable concerns.</strong> Resources and attention devoted
                    to speculative future risks are resources not devoted to present harms. The opportunity cost is
                    real.
                </p>

                <p>
                    None of this means long-term AI risk is unimportant. It means the current discourse is poorly
                    calibrated—treating remote possibilities as certainties while underweighting more immediate
                    concerns.
                </p>

                <h2>What's Actually Going Wrong</h2>

                <p>
                    The real AI safety problems aren't hypothetical. They're happening now:
                </p>

                <h3>Algorithmic Harm at Scale</h3>
                <p>
                    Recommendation algorithms optimize for engagement, which correlates with outrage, polarization, and
                    misinformation. Social media AI systems aren't "misaligned" in some exotic sense—they're doing
                    exactly what they're designed to do. The problem is what they're designed for.
                </p>

                <h3>Automation of Discrimination</h3>
                <p>
                    AI systems trained on historical data perpetuate historical biases. Hiring algorithms discriminate.
                    Predictive policing reinforces existing patterns. These aren't bugs—they're features of systems that
                    learn from biased data.
                </p>

                <h3>Concentration of Power</h3>
                <p>
                    AI capabilities are concentrated in a handful of companies. This concentration affects who benefits
                    from AI advances, who gets to shape AI development, and who bears the costs of disruption. The
                    safety implications of this concentration receive far less attention than speculative
                    superintelligence.
                </p>

                <h3>Erosion of Epistemic Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>
                    Deepfakes, synthetic media, and AI-generated misinformation are degrading our ability to distinguish
                    truth from fiction. This isn't a future risk—it's a present crisis accelerating with each
                    improvement in generative AI.
                </p>

                <h2>The Incentive Problem</h2>

                <p>
                    Why does Silicon Valley focus on speculative future risk while underweighting present harm? Several
                    factors:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Speculative risks don't require present sacrifice.</strong> Worrying about superintelligence
                    is compatible with aggressive AI development today. Addressing present harms might require actual
                    constraints on profitable systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Existential framing creates urgency without accountability.</strong> "We must move fast to
                    ensure AI benefits humanity" sounds responsible while justifying the same aggressive development
                    that causes present harms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Future risk discourse is dominated by AI developers.</strong> The people building AI systems
                    have outsized influence on how we think about AI safety. Their perspective naturally centers risks
                    they might uniquely address rather than harms their systems currently cause.
                </p>

                <h2>What Responsible AI Development Looks Like</h2>

                <p>
                    Moving beyond critique: what should AI safety actually focus on?
                </p>

                <h3>1. Present Accountability</h3>
                <p>
                    AI systems causing harm today should face meaningful consequences today. This means clear liability
                    frameworks, transparency requirements, and enforcement mechanisms. The current
                    approach—self-regulation and voluntary commitments—has demonstrably failed.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Distributing Benefits and Costs</h3>
                <p>
                    AI-driven productivity gains are captured almost entirely by capital owners. AI-driven job
                    displacement falls almost entirely on workers. Genuine AI safety requires addressing this
                    distributional problem, not just technical alignment.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Diversifying Who Shapes AI</h3>
                <p>
                    AI development is shaped by a remarkably narrow slice of humanity: primarily American, primarily
                    male, primarily technical. Genuine safety requires input from people who bear AI's costs, not just
                    those who reap its benefits.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Epistemic Defense</h3>
                <p>
                    We need serious investment in detecting and countering AI-generated misinformation. Not just
                    technical solutions, but also media literacy, institutional credibility, and social resilience
                    against manipulation.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Maintaining Human Agency</h3>
                <p>
                    As AI systems become more capable, preserving meaningful human control becomes harder. Safety means
                    ensuring humans remain in loops that matter—not just rubber-stamping AI decisions, but genuinely
                    shaping outcomes.
                </p>

                <h2>A More Honest Discourse</h2>

                <p>
                    The AI safety conversation would improve if participants did several things:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Distinguished between near-certain present harms and speculative future risks</li>
                    <li>Acknowledged conflicts of interest shaping the discourse</li>
                    <li>Recognized that "safety" means different things to different stakeholders</li>
                    <li>Included voices beyond the narrow circle of AI developers and AI ethicists</li>
                    <li>Connected AI safety to broader questions of power, distribution, and democracy</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    AI is genuinely transformative technology with genuine risks. But the risks extend far beyond
                    superintelligence scenarios. The most pressing concerns aren't speculative—they're observable right
                    now, in systems already deployed at scale.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A safety discourse worthy of the name would grapple with these present realities, not just future
                    possibilities. It would distribute costs and benefits more equitably. And it would subject AI
                    development to genuine democratic accountability rather than the self-governance of those who profit
                    from it.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The most dangerous AI is the one that's already deployed, not the one we're imagining."
