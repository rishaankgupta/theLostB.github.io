                <p>
                    Children ask around 300 questions per day. By the time we reach adulthood, that number drops
                    precipitously. Not because we've found all the answers—we've just stopped wondering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This loss is so gradual we rarely notice it. One day you're fascinated by how planes stay aloft, why
                    the sky is blue, how words carry meaning. Years later, you accept these phenomena as background
                    furniture, unworthy of investigation. The world that once shimmered with mystery becomes merely
                    familiar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What happened between then and now? And can we get it back?
                </p>

                <h2>The Curiosity Killers</h2>

                <p>
                    Several forces conspire to suppress the natural curiosity we're born with:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Schooling.</strong> Traditional education models reward right answers, not interesting
                    questions. We learn that not-knowing is shameful, that inquiry should be efficient and
                    goal-directed, that wondering for its own sake is a waste of time that could be spent preparing for
                    tests.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Specialization.</strong> Modern life demands expertise in narrow domains. The pressure to
                    specialize punishes generalist curiosity as unfocused, dilettantish, professionally irresponsible.
                    We're told to "stay in our lane."
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Expertise itself.</strong> As we become competent in a domain, we develop frameworks that
                    explain most of what we encounter. The frameworks work well enough that we stop questioning them.
                    Expertise, paradoxically, can close as many doors as it opens.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Social signaling.</strong> Asking questions admits ignorance. In environments where
                    appearing smart matters more than becoming smart, we trade curiosity for the performance of
                    competence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Information abundance.</strong> When answers to any factual question are a search away,
                    curiosity can feel obsolete. Why maintain a questioning disposition when Google knows everything
                    already?
                </p>

                <h2>Why Curiosity Mattered</h2>

                <p>
                    The child's approach to learning works because curiosity provides intrinsic motivation. When you're
                    genuinely interested, learning requires no willpower. You pursue understanding the way you pursue
                    food when hungry—not as obligation but as need.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This curiosity-driven learning produces qualitatively different results:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deeper encoding.</strong> Material connected to genuine interest lodges more durably in
                        memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Broader connections.</strong> Curiosity ranges across domains, finding unexpected
                        linkages that specialized study misses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainable engagement.</strong> Interest sustains attention where discipline eventually
                        depletes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creative insight.</strong> Many breakthroughs come from asking naive questions that
                        experts consider settled.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The productivity literature focuses on motivation techniques for doing things we don't want to do.
                    But the most productive people I know don't need much motivation—they've found work that genuinely
                    interests them. The upstream intervention is cultivating curiosity about the right things.
                </p>

                <h2>Reclaiming Wonder</h2>

                <p>
                    Curiosity atrophies without use but can be exercised back into strength. Some practices that help:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Notice what you don't understand.</strong> Most daily life operates in a fog of accepted
                    confusion. We use technologies, navigate systems, and rely on knowledge we can't explain. Start
                    noticing: "I actually don't know how this works." The first step is seeing ignorance clearly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Follow digressions.</strong> When something catches your interest during work, don't always
                    suppress it for later. Sometimes, follow the thread. The digression might be more valuable than the
                    task it interrupted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Read outside your domain.</strong> Curiosity flourishes at boundaries. Read history if you
                    do science; read science if you do art; read philosophy if you do business. The unfamiliar provokes
                    questions the familiar no longer can.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Ask "why" repeatedly.</strong> The child's technique of asking "why" five times in
                    succession penetrates deeper than single-layer explanation. Most answers are themselves mysteries
                    that bear further investigation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Spend time with curious people.</strong> Curiosity is contagious. Conversations with
                    genuinely interested people surface questions you wouldn't have formulated alone and model inquiry
                    as a way of being.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Accept not-knowing.</strong> Much curiosity suppression is shame about ignorance. Reframe
                    not-knowing as the beginning of interesting inquiry rather than embarrassing failure.
                </p>

                <h2>Curiosity as Ethic</h2>

                <p>
                    There's something almost moral about maintaining genuine curiosity. It requires intellectual
                    humility—acknowledging that you don't know things worth knowing. It requires patience—being willing
                    to sit with confusion before demanding resolution. It requires courage—asking questions that might
                    reveal your ignorance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And it produces a particular orientation toward other people and ideas: openness rather than
                    defensiveness, interest rather than dismissal, genuine engagement rather than performance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The incurious life is easier in some ways. You can operate within established frameworks, collect
                    credentials that signal competence, avoid the discomfort of confusion. But something is lost—a
                    vitality that makes learning joyful rather than obligatory, that keeps the world interesting even as
                    you age.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm sixteen. I presumably have many decades of potential curiosity loss ahead of me. Writing this is
                    partly an attempt to establish defenses while the disposition is still strong—to articulate what I
                    want to protect before I forget why it matters.
                </p>
