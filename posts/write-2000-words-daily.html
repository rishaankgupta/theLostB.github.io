                <p>
                    For the past year, I've averaged about 2,000 words of publishable writing per day. Some days more,
                    some less, but the volume has been consistent. People ask how, expecting tips on inspiration or
                    creativity. The answer is more boring: systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Talent is unreliable. Motivation fluctuates. Systems persist. What follows is the infrastructure
                    that makes consistent output possible, regardless of how I feel on any given day.
                </p>

                <h2>The Daily Schedule</h2>

                <p>
                    Writing happens first thing in the morning, before anything else—before phone, before email, before
                    decisions. The research is clear: willpower depletes through the day. Creative work should happen
                    when cognitive resources are fullest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My morning routine: Wake at 6:00. No phone. Make coffee. Sit down to write by 6:20. Write until 8:30
                    or until I hit 2,000 words, whichever comes first. Only then does the rest of the day begin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This isn't discipline—it's architecture. When writing is the first thing I do, there's nothing to
                    get through first. When it's non-negotiable, there's no daily decision to make. The habit carries me
                    through days when willpower wouldn't.
                </p>

                <h2>The Idea System</h2>

                <p>
                    Sitting down to write with nothing to write about is a recipe for staring at a blank page. I never
                    start writing from zero. Ideas are captured constantly, developed in the background, and ready when
                    I need them.
                </p>

                <h3>Capture</h3>
                <p>
                    Every idea that occurs to me—during reading, walking, conversation, shower—gets immediately
                    captured. Phone note, pocket notebook, voice memo. The medium doesn't matter; the practice of never
                    letting ideas evaporate does.
                </p>

                <h3>Incubate</h3>
                <p>
                    Weekly, I review captured ideas. Some are stupid and get deleted. Some need more development and
                    stay in the queue. Some are ready to be outlined. The key is that by the time I sit down to write,
                    the idea has been cooking for weeks.
                </p>

                <h3>Ready to Write</h3>
                <p>
                    I maintain a list of "ready to write" pieces—ideas that have outlines, rough structure, and clear
                    through-lines. When I sit down in the morning, I never have to wonder what to write. I just pick
                    from the queue.
                </p>

                <h2>The Draft Zero Method</h2>

                <p>
                    My first drafts are terrible. This is deliberate. I've separated the creative phase from the
                    editorial phase, and they never happen in the same session.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Draft Zero:</strong> Get ideas from brain to page with zero concern for quality. If I get
                    stuck, I write "TK FIX LATER" and move on. No going back, no editing, no judgment. Just forward
                    motion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Editing passes:</strong> After Draft Zero sits for at least a day, I edit ruthlessly.
                    Multiple passes with different lenses: structure, logic, clarity, style. This is slow, careful
                    work—the opposite of drafting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The separation is crucial. When I tried to write well on the first pass, I wrote nothing. The
                    internal editor killed ideas before they formed. Now the editor is locked out until drafting is
                    complete.
                </p>

                <h2>The Environment</h2>

                <p>
                    I write in a space optimized for writing and nothing else. Specific desk, specific chair, specific
                    lighting. When I sit there, my brain knows what's expected.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Environmental details that matter:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Minimal setup:</strong> No visible distractions. Phone in another room. Internet blocker
                        active during writing blocks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Same tools:</strong> Same text editor, same font, same interface. Reduces friction and
                        decision fatigue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background sound:</strong> I use the same ambient playlist every session. It becomes an
                        auditory trigger for writing mode.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical comfort:</strong> Good chair, proper desk height, comfortable temperature.
                        Discomfort breaks focus.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Commitment Device</h2>

                <p>
                    I've made the habit hard to break through external commitments. A newsletter sends every week
                    whether I feel like it or not. A blog has expectations. Public deadlines create accountability that
                    internal goals can't match.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This isn't about pressure—it's about removing optionality. When "should I write today?" isn't even a
                    question because subscribers expect content, the answer is always yes.
                </p>

                <h2>What About Writer's Block?</h2>

                <p>
                    I don't believe in writer's block as a mystical condition. When I can't write, there's always a
                    diagnosable cause:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No ideas ready:</strong> Fix by building a better idea pipeline.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfectionism paralysis:</strong> Fix by embracing terrible first drafts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unclear thinking:</strong> Fix by researching and outlining more before writing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Fix by protecting sleep and writing when fresh.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When "blocked," I lower the bar. Write one sentence. Then another. The momentum usually returns. And
                    if it doesn't, I work on editing instead—a different cognitive mode that might unstick the creative
                    one.
                </p>

                <h2>The Long View</h2>

                <p>
                    2,000 words per day is about 700,000 words per year. That's seven books, or a hundred substantial
                    essays, or both. Compounded over years, it's a body of work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The magic isn't in any single day. Most daily output is mediocre. But quantity creates chances for
                    quality. Among 100 essays, some will be good. Among 10 essays, who knows?
                </p>

                <p>
                    More importantly, the practice makes you better. Each essay teaches something. Feedback loops
                    accumulate. The 100th essay is better than the first not despite the others but because of them.
                </p>
