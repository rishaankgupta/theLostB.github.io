                    Modern career advice is unanimous: specialize. Pick a niche. Become the best in the world at one
                    narrow thing. Depth beats breadth. Focus beats exploration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This advice isn't wrong, exactly—specialists clearly succeed. But it ignores an alternative path
                    that's both viable and increasingly valuable: the polymath path. Pursuing expertise across multiple
                    domains rather than supreme mastery in one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm sixteen, which means I haven't specialized yet. This post is partly a justification for my
                    reluctance to narrow down prematurely, and partly an argument that breadth itself is worth
                    cultivating.
                </p>

                <h2>The Case Against Early Specialization</h2>

                <p>
                    The standard trajectory goes: pick a field in your twenties, spend decades going deep, achieve
                    mastery. By sixty, you're a world expert in something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The problems with this model:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>You choose before you know.</strong> At 18, when most people commit to a path, you've barely
                    explored what exists. The field you'd love might be one you've never encountered. Early
                    specialization forecloses discovery.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Fields change faster than careers.</strong> The specialty you entered as a young person may
                    not exist when you're old. Generalist skills—writing, thinking, learning itself—persist even as
                    specific domains transform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Deep specialization has diminishing returns.</strong> Going from 90th to 99th percentile in
                    one skill requires enormous effort. Going from 50th to 90th percentile in two or three skills might
                    create more value with less investment.
                </p>

                <h2>The Value of Breadth</h2>

                <p>
                    What do polymaths bring that specialists don't?
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Cross-pollination.</strong> Novel ideas often come from importing concepts between domains.
                    The biologist who knows physics discovers something neither would alone. The writer who codes thinks
                    about language differently. Knowledge compounds non-linearly across fields.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Adaptability.</strong> When one domain collapses, the polymath pivots. When the specialist's
                    niche disappears, years of expertise become irrelevant. Breadth creates resilience against
                    uncertainty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Conversation fluency.</strong> A polymathic person can collaborate with specialists across
                    fields. They translate between domains, connect people who'd otherwise never meet, and hold projects
                    together that span disciplines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Better judgment on complex problems.</strong> Real problems don't respect academic
                    boundaries. Climate change is physics and economics and politics. AI is computer science and
                    philosophy and psychology. Narrow specialists see narrow slices; polymaths see more of the whole.
                </p>

                <h2>The Talent Stack Model</h2>

                <p>
                    Scott Adams (Dilbert creator) argues that you don't need to be world-class at anything if you're
                    pretty good at several things that rarely combine. He calls this a "talent stack."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adams is:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A decent artist (not top 1%)</li>
                    <li>Reasonably funny (not top 1%)</li>
                    <li>Understands business (not top 1%)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    But the intersection—someone who can draw competently, is funny, and understands corporate
                    culture—is rare enough to be valuable. Dilbert emerged from the stack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My version: I'm a decent writer, I understand technology, I've read philosophy, I'm building online.
                    None of these are exceptional individually. But writing about technology through a philosophical
                    lens while building a platform? That combination has less competition than any single component.
                </p>

                <h2>The Practical Path</h2>

                <p>
                    How do you actually become a polymath in a world structured for specialists?
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Have a "base" and "explorations."</strong> Pick one domain to anchor in—deep enough to be
                    credible, to pay bills, to contribute seriously. Then explore widely while maintaining that home
                    base. You're not a dilettante if you have a foundation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Learn fundamentals, not trivia.</strong> You don't need exhaustive knowledge of every field.
                    You need the core mental models that experts use. 20% of any domain produces 80% of the insight.
                    Chase those fundamentals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Follow curiosity, not credentials.</strong> Academic programs produce specialists.
                    Self-directed learning can produce polymaths. Read widely, learn actively, let interest guide you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Build at intersections.</strong> Create work that draws from multiple domains. Writing that
                    synthesizes. Projects that bridge. The work itself teaches you to integrate knowledge rather than
                    compartmentalize it.
                </p>

                <h2>The Honest Trade-Offs</h2>

                <p>
                    This isn't purely upside. The polymath path involves real costs:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You'll never be the best in any single field</li>
                    <li>Credentials may be harder to acquire</li>
                    <li>Some institutions don't know what to do with you</li>
                    <li>You must explain yourself more often</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The choice isn't objectively better or worse—it's a different strategy. Some people thrive with
                    focus; some thrive with breadth. The key is choosing intentionally rather than defaulting to
                    whatever path is most conventional.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship,
                    design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying,
                    take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch
                    manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is
                    for insects."
