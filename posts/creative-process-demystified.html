                <p>
                    The Romantic myth of creativity: inspiration strikes the genius spontaneously. The muse visits. The
                    idea appears fully formed, a gift from somewhere beyond. The creator is a vessel, not an agent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This isn't how creativity actually works. Creativity is a process—one that can be understood,
                    practiced, and improved. The mystification of creativity serves those who have it and discourages
                    those who don't. Demystifying it makes it accessible.
                </p>

                <h2>The Stages of Creative Work</h2>

                <p>
                    Graham Wallas, in 1926, identified four stages in the creative process. A century of research has
                    validated his model:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Preparation</h3>
                <p>
                    Before insight comes immersion. You gather raw material: reading widely, researching deeply,
                    exposing yourself to relevant and seemingly irrelevant inputs. Creativity combines existing
                    elements; you can't combine what you don't have.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This stage feels like work because it is work. There's no shortcut. The polymath advantage appears
                    here—the more diverse your knowledge base, the more unusual combinations become possible.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Incubation</h3>
                <p>
                    After conscious effort, you step away. Go for walks. Sleep. Work on other things. The subconscious
                    continues processing what the conscious mind gathered, forming connections below awareness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This stage looks like not working. It's actually essential. The shower insight, the walk epiphany,
                    the middle-of-the-night solution—all emerge from incubation. You can't force it, but you can allow
                    it by not filling every moment with new input.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Illumination</h3>
                <p>
                    The moment of insight. The idea arrives, often suddenly, often when you're not actively seeking it.
                    This is what the Romantic myth focuses on exclusively—but it only happens because of the preparation
                    and incubation that preceded it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The "aha" feels magical because the subconscious work that produced it was invisible. You experience
                    the result without witnessing the process.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Verification</h3>
                <p>
                    Ideas that feel brilliant at 3 AM may be nonsense at 9 AM. Verification tests the insight: Does it
                    actually work? Does it solve the problem? Can it be communicated? This is the craft side of
                    creativity—the discipline that separates workable ideas from mere notions.
                </p>

                <h2>Conditions for Creativity</h2>

                <p>
                    Certain conditions make the creative process more likely to succeed:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Constraints.</strong> Counter-intuitively, constraints enhance creativity. "Write anything"
                    produces paralysis; "write a sonnet about loss" produces output. The creative mind works best when
                    given a problem to solve, boundaries to push against.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Exposure to diverse inputs.</strong> Creativity recombines. The more varied your
                    inputs—different fields, cultures, perspectives—the more unusual your combinations can be. Read
                    outside your domain. Talk to people unlike yourself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Time for incubation.</strong> Cramming kills creativity. Ideas need time to develop.
                    Scheduling breaks, protecting unstructured time, and getting adequate sleep all support the
                    incubation that conscious effort can't replace.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Low-stakes exploration.</strong> Fear of judgment kills creative risk-taking. Environments
                    where failure is safe produce more experimentation. The best ideas often emerge from play, not from
                    high-pressure performance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Regular practice.</strong> Creativity is a muscle. The more you exercise it, the stronger it
                    gets. Daily creative practice—writing, sketching, building—keeps the pipeline flowing even when no
                    particular project demands it.
                </p>

                <h2>Practical Techniques</h2>

                <h3>Combinatorial Creativity</h3>
                <p>
                    Take two unrelated domains and force a connection. What would X look like if designed like Y? How
                    would field A approach the problems of field B? Many innovations are imports: applying ideas proven
                    in one context to another.
                </p>

                <h3>Constraint Manipulation</h3>
                <p>
                    Change the constraints on a problem to see it fresh. What if you had unlimited budget? Zero budget?
                    Half the time? Double the team? The impossible constraints reveal hidden assumptions; achievable
                    variations of impossible solutions often emerge.
                </p>

                <h3>Structured Ideation</h3>
                <p>
                    Generate many ideas before evaluating any. Set a number (20 ideas, 50 ideas) and force yourself to
                    reach it. The first ideas are obvious; later ideas, when you've exhausted the obvious, are often
                    better.
                </p>

                <h3>Sleep on It</h3>
                <p>
                    When stuck, work on the problem intensely, then deliberately stop. Sleep. The morning often brings
                    perspective that evening effort couldn't reach. This isn't procrastination—it's strategic
                    incubation.
                </p>

                <h2>Creativity in the Age of AI</h2>

                <p>
                    AI tools can now generate text, images, music, and code. Does this make human creativity obsolete?
                    I'd argue the opposite: human creativity becomes more important, just redirected.
                </p>

                <p>
                    AI is excellent at recombination within trained distributions. It's poor at genuine novelty, at
                    questioning assumptions, at knowing what's worth creating. The creative human plus AI tools produces
                    better output than either alone—but the human provides direction, taste, and purpose that AI cannot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The creative skill becomes curation and direction: knowing what to ask for, recognizing what's good,
                    iterating toward excellence. These are still creative capacities, even if some execution becomes
                    automated.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they
                    feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something."
                    <br>— Steve Jobs
