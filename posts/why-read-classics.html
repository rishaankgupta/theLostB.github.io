                <p>
                    Every day, more content is published than anyone could consume in a lifetime. The sheer volume
                    creates an obvious question: with so much new material available, why would anyone spend time on
                    books written centuries ago by people long dead?
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've spent the past year reading classics deliberately—Homer, Plato, Montaigne, Dostoevsky,
                    Austen—alongside plenty of contemporary work. The contrast clarified why classics matter in ways I
                    hadn't expected.
                </p>

                <h2>The Lindy Effect</h2>

                <p>
                    The Lindy Effect suggests that the longer something has survived, the longer it's likely to continue
                    surviving. A book that's been read for two thousand years is more likely to be read for another
                    hundred years than a book published last month.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This isn't mysticism—it's selection pressure. Most ideas, once expressed, are quickly forgotten. The
                    few that persist across generations do so because they keep proving valuable to new readers in new
                    circumstances. Time is a filter that has already done work you'd otherwise have to do yourself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you read Marcus Aurelius or Seneca, you're not reading work that happened to survive. You're
                    reading work that was selected, repeatedly, by billions of readers across millennia. The odds that
                    it contains something worthwhile are higher than any bestseller list can match.
                </p>

                <h2>Escape from the Present</h2>

                <p>
                    Contemporary culture has a particular character: its assumptions, metaphors, and concerns. When you
                    only consume current work, you absorb these assumptions unconsciously. They become invisible because
                    they're so pervasive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classics come from different worlds with different assumptions. The Greeks conceived of honor
                    differently; the Victorians conceived of duty differently; the Medievals conceived of meaning
                    differently. Encountering these alternatives makes your own cultural assumptions visible—and thus
                    questionable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This isn't relativism. You don't have to adopt ancient views. But understanding that intelligent
                    people have held very different views forces genuine reflection on why you hold yours.
                </p>

                <h2>The Well-Spoken Mind</h2>

                <p>
                    Your internal monologue is composed in language. The quality and range of that language shapes what
                    you can think. Feeding your mind on tweets and LinkedIn posts produces a certain vocabulary; feeding
                    it on Shakespeare and Milton produces another.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classics expand not just vocabulary but the possibilities of expression. Reading Montaigne teaches
                    you to be a personal essayist; reading Nietzsche teaches you to be an aphorist; reading Austen
                    teaches you to be ironic. These aren't just stylistic preferences—they're different modes of thought
                    that become available through reading.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I notice this most when writing. Phrases and patterns absorbed from classic authors surface
                    naturally. Reading good prose teaches you to write good prose in ways that reading about writing
                    never can.
                </p>

                <h2>The Shared Inheritance</h2>

                <p>
                    Western culture is in constant dialogue with its classics. Modern literature references, parodies,
                    and builds on works that came before. Without knowing the originals, you miss the conversation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you read the Odyssey, you suddenly understand references in work from Dante to Joyce to Coen
                    Brothers films. The Bible, Shakespeare, Greek mythology—these aren't arbitrary reading lists but
                    central nodes in a cultural network. Knowing them makes everything else richer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This applies far beyond literature. Political philosophy engages Plato, Locke, Rousseau. Modern
                    ethics engages Aristotle and Kant. Science engages Newton, Darwin, Einstein. The thinkers who shaped
                    current discourse are still worth knowing directly.
                </p>

                <h2>Slower Reading</h2>

                <p>
                    Contemporary content is optimized for easy consumption. Classics often aren't. They require
                    patience, re-reading, and effort that modern media conditions us against.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This difficulty is a feature, not a bug. Struggling with a text engages you in ways that
                    frictionless consumption doesn't. You can't skim Kant or speedread Dostoevsky—you have to actually
                    think.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The effort of reading classics trains a particular cognitive capacity: the ability to grapple with
                    difficult ideas over extended periods. This transfers beyond books to any complex problem that can't
                    be understood quickly.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Start</h2>

                <p>
                    If classics seem daunting, some approaches make them more accessible:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start with translations that read well.</strong> A good modern translation of Homer
                        beats a clunky older one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Read alongside commentary.</strong> Introductions and reading guides provide context
                        that makes old texts more accessible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Begin with shorter works.</strong> Seneca's letters, Montaigne's essays, short dialogues
                        of Plato—you don't have to start with War and Peace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow interest.</strong> The classics that resonate vary by person. Read widely enough
                        to find your own canon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reread.</strong> Classics reveal new layers on rereading. A book you read at sixteen
                        hits differently at twenty, and will again at forty.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Objection</h2>

                <p>
                    "But the world has changed. What can dead people teach us about modern problems?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    More than you'd expect. Technology changes rapidly; human nature changes slowly. The psychology
                    Dostoevsky depicted, the ethics Aristotle analyzed, the political dynamics Thucydides observed—these
                    remain relevant because the humans involved haven't changed much.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Contemporary thinkers are often more useful for understanding specific current situations. But
                    classics address perennial questions that current situations exemplify. Both perspectives are
                    valuable; neither is complete.
                </p>
