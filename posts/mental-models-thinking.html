            <div class="prose max-w-none">
                <p>
                    Mental models are thinking tools—frameworks you can apply across domains to understand situations
                    and make decisions. The more models you have, the more ways you can analyze problems. A carpenter
                    with only a hammer sees every problem as a nail; a thinker with many models can match tool to
                    problem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are the models that most changed how I think. Not an exhaustive catalog, but a personal canon
                    of frameworks that have proven useful repeatedly.
                </p>

                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3 class="mt-0">1. Inversion</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">Instead of asking "How do I succeed?" ask "How would I guarantee failure?" Then
                        avoid those things.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Inversion cuts through complexity. When I can't figure out what to do, I can usually figure out what
                    would definitely be wrong. The answer often becomes obvious once I list the failure modes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Applying it: Before a new project, list everything that would make it fail. Before a conversation,
                    list everything that would make it go badly. The inverted perspective reveals risks you wouldn't see
                    directly.
                </p>

                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3 class="mt-0">2. Second-Order Thinking</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">Ask "And then what?" beyond the immediate consequences. Most decisions have effects
                        that cascade.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    First-order thinkers see one move ahead. Second-order thinkers trace the chain of consequences. A
                    policy that sounds great might have second-order effects that make it terrible; an investment that
                    sounds bad might have second-order benefits that make it brilliant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Applying it: For any decision, explicitly trace at least two levels of consequences. What happens
                    next? And after that? The best decisions look good at multiple levels.
                </p>

                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3 class="mt-0">3. Circle of Competence</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">Know what you actually understand versus what you think you understand. Stay within
                        the former.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Everyone has domains where they have genuine expertise and domains where they're operating on vibes.
                    The key is knowing which is which. Those who confuse the two make costly mistakes; those who stay in
                    their circle—while working to expand it—make fewer errors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Applying it: For important decisions, honestly assess: Am I within my circle of competence? If not,
                    either get help from someone who is, or invest in understanding before acting.
                </p>

                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3 class="mt-0">4. Opportunity Cost</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">The true cost of something is not just what you pay, but what you give up by
                        choosing it.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Every choice forecloses other choices. The college you attend means not attending others. The book
                    you read means not reading another. This seems obvious, but we routinely fail to account for it,
                    evaluating options in isolation rather than against alternatives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Applying it: For any significant commitment, ask: What else could I do with this time/money/energy?
                    Is this the best possible use, or just better than nothing?
                </p>

                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3 class="mt-0">5. Hanlon's Razor</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity (or
                        ignorance, or accident).</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    When someone wrongs you, the instinct is to assume they acted intentionally. Usually they just
                    weren't thinking. Assuming malice creates conflict where none was required; assuming accident
                    preserves relationships while still allowing you to address the problem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Applying it: When something goes wrong with other people involved, start with the assumption of
                    incompetence or accident, not malice. You can always update toward malice if evidence requires, but
                    starting there rarely helps.
                </p>

                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3 class="mt-0">6. Maps and Territory</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">The map is not the territory. Models represent reality; they are not reality itself.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Every model, framework, or theory simplifies some aspects of reality to make others tractable. The
                    usefulness of a model depends on context—a model perfect for one purpose may be useless for another.
                    Confusing the model with reality leads to applying it where it doesn't fit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Applying it: For any model you use (including these), remember what it leaves out. When the model's
                    predictions mismatch reality, update the model, not your perception of reality.
                </p>

                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3 class="mt-0">7. Ergodicity</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">What works on average doesn't always work for individuals over time. Avoid risks
                        that can eliminate you.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Russian roulette has positive expected value (5/6 chance of winning the pot, 1/6 chance of death).
                    But you can't play enough rounds for the average to manifest—the 1/6 outcome ends your game. Many
                    risks work this way: favorable on average, but catastrophic for any individual who draws the wrong
                    number.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Applying it: Identify risks with catastrophic downside (ruin, death, irreversibility) and avoid them
                    regardless of expected value. Never risk what you can't afford to lose.
                </p>

                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3 class="mt-0">8. Comparative Advantage</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">Do what you do relatively better, even if others do it absolutely better. Trade
                        completes the picture.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    You don't need to be the best at something for it to be worth doing. You need to be relatively
                    better at it compared to your other options, while others are relatively better at what they do.
                    Specialization and trade beat trying to do everything yourself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Applying it: Focus on what you do comparatively well; outsource or trade for what others do
                    comparatively better. Even if you're better at both tasks, your time is better spent on your
                    strongest area.
                </p>

                <h2>Using Models Together</h2>

                <p>
                    The power of mental models increases with quantity. A single model gives one perspective; multiple
                    models give triangulation. When several models converge on the same answer, you can have more
                    confidence. When they diverge, you know to investigate further.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Charlie Munger calls this "latticework of mental models"—the interconnected framework that supports
                    clearer thinking. Building it takes years. Reading widely across disciplines. Studying how experts
                    in different fields think. Practicing application until models become reflexive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Start with a few. Apply them deliberately until they become automatic. Add more over time. The
                    investment compounds—each additional model makes all the others more useful.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "I think it is undeniably true that the human brain must work in models. The trick is to have your
                    brain work better than the other person's brain because it understands the most fundamental models."
