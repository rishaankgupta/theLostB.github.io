                <p>
                    Time is the fundamental constraint. Every other resource—money, attention, energy—can be saved,
                    borrowed, or recovered. Time only flows in one direction, non-negotiably, for everyone equally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We speak of "spending" time as if it were money, but the metaphor breaks down. You can earn more
                    money; you cannot earn more time. Every moment spent is gone permanently, regardless of whether it
                    was spent well or wasted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is the starting point for any serious philosophy of living: the recognition that time is
                    finite, irreversible, and ultimately the only thing that matters.
                </p>

                <h2>The Brevity of Life</h2>

                <p>
                    Seneca opens his essay "On the Shortness of Life" with the observation that people complain
                    constantly about not having enough time—yet waste most of what they have. The problem isn't that
                    life is short; it's that we squander it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "We are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of
                    it... Life is long if you know how to use it."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two thousand years later, this diagnosis hits harder than ever. We have more leisure time than any
                    previous generation, more tools for meaningful engagement, more options for how to spend our
                    days—and yet somehow feel more time-poor than ever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The culprits are familiar: distraction, busyness mistaken for productivity, obligations accumulated
                    without examination, entertainment that numbs rather than refreshes. We drift through years that, in
                    retrospect, seem to have passed without our genuine participation.
                </p>

                <h2>Memento Mori</h2>

                <p>
                    The ancient practice of contemplating death—<em>memento mori</em>, "remember you will die"—sounds
                    morbid but functions as a clarifying force.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Awareness of death doesn't produce paralysis or despair; it produces perspective. Petty conflicts
                    shrink. Trivial pursuits reveal their triviality. What genuinely matters becomes easier to see.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Stoics kept death constantly in view not because they were depressed but precisely because they
                    weren't. Facing mortality directly is what allows you to live fully rather than sleepwalking through
                    years on autopilot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm sixteen. In the normal case, I have many decades ahead. The temptation is to defer difficult
                    things, to act as if time is abundant. But this is exactly the illusion that leads to wasted years.
                    The abundance is never real; one day there will be no more, and the boundary between now and then
                    can arrive at any moment.
                </p>

                <h2>The Quality of Time</h2>

                <p>
                    Not all time is equal. An hour of deep work produces more than an hour of distracted multitasking.
                    An hour with a close friend means more than an hour of superficial networking. An hour spent on what
                    matters compounds; an hour spent on what doesn't is simply gone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This suggests that "time management" misses the point. The question isn't how to fit more into time,
                    but how to ensure the time you have is spent on what actually matters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Defining what matters is personal, but some patterns emerge:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Relationships.</strong> No one on their deathbed regrets spending too much time with
                        people they loved. Connection is where meaning lives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Craft.</strong> Developing skills, creating things, contributing work that outlasts
                        you—the sense that your time produced something.</li>
                    <li><strong>Experience.</strong> Not consumption for its own sake, but genuine engagement with the
                        world—adventures, explorations, the novel and challenging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth.</strong> Becoming more capable, wiser, better. The trajectory matters—stagnation
                        is a form of death.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Practical Implications</h2>

                <p>
                    A philosophy of time leads to concrete practices:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Audit how you actually spend time.</strong> Track a week. The gap between how you think you
                    spend time and how you actually spend it is usually shocking. Awareness precedes change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Say no more often.</strong> Every yes implies many nos. Accepting an obligation, a meeting,
                    a project means declining everything else those hours could hold. Default to no; say yes only to
                    what genuinely warrants the cost.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Protect the important from the urgent.</strong> Urgent things demand attention; important
                    things don't. Without deliberate defense, the urgent will consume all available time while the
                    important waits indefinitely.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Resist the illusion of later.</strong> "I'll do it eventually" usually means "never." What
                    matters enough to do belongs on the calendar, with a commitment. What doesn't make the calendar
                    probably won't happen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Notice the present.</strong> Much of life passes in autopilot—physically present but
                    mentally absent. The practice of presence reclaims time that would otherwise slip by unnoticed.
                </p>

                <h2>The Paradox of Urgency</h2>

                <p>
                    Here's the strange thing: awareness of mortality, done right, doesn't produce frantic rushing. It
                    produces clarity that allows calm.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you know what matters and focus there, you can relax about everything else. The busyness that
                    masquerades as importance reveals itself as noise. You can work intensely on the essential without
                    anxiety about the non-essential.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is different from pretending time is infinite (which leads to waste) or being constantly
                    anxious about time (which produces burnout without focus). It's clear-eyed acceptance of constraint,
                    used to prioritize rather than panic.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough,
                    and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all
                    well invested."
                    <br>— Seneca
