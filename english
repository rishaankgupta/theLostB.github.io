**To the Admissions Committee,**

I am pleased to recommend [Student Name] for admission to your school. As [his/her] English teacher for [timeframe], I have been impressed by [his/her] language development, intellectual curiosity, and determination.

What makes [Student Name] particularly remarkable in my English class is that [he/she] is largely self-taught in English. [His/Her] family does not speak English at home, yet [he/she] has developed [**TEACHER CAN DESCRIBE ENGLISH LEVEL - e.g., "strong reading comprehension," "good written expression," "improving communication skills," etc.**] through independent study. This demonstrates extraordinary motivation and learning capability.

In class, [Student Name] [**TEACHER CAN ADD CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR - e.g., "participates thoughtfully in discussions," "is quieter but attentive," "produces careful written work," etc.**]. [**TEACHER CAN ADD SPECIFIC EXAMPLE - e.g., "I particularly remember when..." or "During our study of [text/topic]..."**]

I should note that [Student Name's] English proficiency, while strong, is still developing in some areas [**TEACHER CAN SPECIFY IF KNOWN - e.g., "particularly in spoken fluency," "in complex grammar structures," "in vocabulary range," etc.**]. This is entirely understandable given [his/her] self-taught background and limited exposure to English outside of school. I am confident that immersion in an English-speaking environment like your school would accelerate [his/her] language development significantly.

Beyond language skills, I have observed [Student Name] to be [**TEACHER CAN ADD CHARACTER TRAITS - e.g., "thoughtful," "respectful," "diligent," "curious about literature/ideas," etc.**]. [**TEACHER CAN ADD ANY OTHER OBSERVATIONS ABOUT INTERESTS, WORK HABITS, OR CHARACTER.**]

What impresses me most about [Student Name] is [his/her] ability to overcome barriers through self-directed effort. Learning English independently while managing schoolwork in other subjects shows remarkable dedication and capability. [He/She] is ready for the challenges of an English-language boarding school environment.

I recommend [Student Name] for admission to your school and believe [he/she] will thrive in your academic community.

Sincerely,
